            Dear Mahi Didi,
        </p>
        <p>
            Sorry for the Demand of the book I know you do not earn and still I asked you for the book . I was feeling very  anxious in asking still I asked . But thank you and sorry if there was something disheartening in my talk because I am 75% introvert so I don't know the approach and by your voice it was feeling that you felt a bit sad because normally I don't call you but to ask for the book I called you it seems to be mean , I understand but you said that you will gift me what I ask for so I didn't thought about the other perspective .
            And again sorry and Thank you .
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for everything you do. I love you so much!
        </p>
